# HealthyPartionoRemover
Remove Unused Partion Between Other To Extend C or earlier drives
Today I was trying to extend my C drive and i had aother partion which was 300GB . But operation fails in Diskmanagment windows tools , because 
when u want to extend a drive both drive should become after each other , If you Have Drive C D E F U can not shrink drive F to c . 
Sometime you have to make deal whith HealthyPartion recovery which your are not be able to remove , That why i made C# Script to do this .
Script Tested And Works Wel . 
Please Note : You have to Run Script As Adminitrative User.Other U get Failed.
Normaly for this type of problems you have make deal whit Third Party Aplications , Which Not likable.
Here free Class for use and cheers.
